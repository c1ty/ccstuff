# Turtle Remote

Supercharge manual turtle control with this handy remote control-program for turtles. 

## The Idea

I came up with the idea when I decided to use my turtle as a pseudo-diamond pickaxe for 
gathering obsidian. While you surely can manually enter combinations of 
`turtle.digDown()`, `turtle.forward()` and `turtle.turnLeft()` into the interactive lua-prompt,
this gets quite tedious after some time, at least for me. So I decided to 
write a small little remote-control that utilizes the portability of advanced 
wirless pocket computers.

## The Setup

Required Hardware:
* an advanced wireless pocket computer
* a wireless (mining) turtle

Currently there is no support for refueling, so you'll have to keep an eye on that. However there is 
a label for the remote (the pocket computer) that shows the fuel-level of the turtle.

Required Software:
